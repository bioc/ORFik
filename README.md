ORFik: R package for discovery of novel genes.
==============================================================================

This package is still under development, although this version is stable and can be used.

#### About


ORFik is a R package containing various functions for analysis of Ribo-Seq, RNA-Seq, CAGE and TCP-seq data related to transcriptomics. ORFik currently supports:

- Finding Open Reading Frames (very fast) in the genome of interest or on the set of transcripts.
- Metaplots for Ribo-Seq allowing to spot the shift.
- Automatically detecting shifts for Ribo-Seq data.
- Various measurements of gene identity e.g. FLOSS, coverage, ORFscore, entropy.
- CAGE reassignment of leaders in txdb/GenomicRanges objects.
- Easy creation of coverage plots of sequence data over transcript regions.
- Utility functions to extend and speed up GenomicRanges, e.g. the functions tile1, groupGRangesBy and pmapFromTranscriptF.



#### Installation
Package is available from bioconductor (3.11, R version >= 4.0.0)
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ORFik")
```

Development version on bioconductor (3.12, R version >= 4.0.0)
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))

```  

Package is also available here on github
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("Roleren/ORFik")
```
