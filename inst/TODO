TODO
-----------------------
    o Make check for spaces in findORFsFasta
    o remove unnecesary type checking ("started doing this now")
    o split files into smaller files, tests too
    o remove whole utils file?

    CageSeq:
    o remove cageFromFile etc. so that we don't load the data for the user
    o remove filterCage so that we don't filter, user filters himself

    RiboSeq:
    o parseCigar implement into C++ (this is not the slow part thought)
