Description: R package for analysis of transcript and translation features through manipulation of sequence data
  and NGS data like Ribo-Seq, RNA-Seq, TCP-Seq and CAGE. It is generalized in the sense that any transcript region
  can be analysed, as the name hints to it was made with investigation of ribosomal patterns over 
  Open Reading Frames (ORFs) as it's primary use case. 
  ORFik is extremely fast through use of C++, data.table and GenomicRanges. 
  Package allows to reassign starts of the transcripts with the use of CAGE-Seq data,
  automatic shifting of RiboSeq reads, finding of Open Reading Frames for
  whole genomes and much more.
