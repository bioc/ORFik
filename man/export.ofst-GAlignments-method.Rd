\title{Store GRanges / GAlignments object as .ofst}
\usage{
\S4method{export.ofst}{GAlignments}(x, file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a GRanges, GAlignments or GAlignmentPairs object}

\item{file}{a character, location on disc (full path)}

\item{...}{additional arguments for write_fst}
}
\value{
NULL, object saved to disc
}
\description{
A much faster way to store, load and use bam files.\cr
.ofst is ORFik fast serialized object,
an optimized bed format for coverage reads with
cigar and replicate number.\cr
.ofst is a text based format with minimum 4 columns:\cr
1. chromosome\cr  2. start (left most position) \cr 3. strand (+, -, *)\cr
4. width (not added if cigar exists)\cr
5. cigar (not needed if width exists):
 (cigar # M's, match/mismatch total) \cr
5. score: duplicates of that read\cr
6. size: qwidth according to reference of read\cr\cr
If file is from GAlignmentPairs, it will contain a cigar1, cigar2 instead
of cigar and start1 and start2 instead of start
}
\details{
Other columns can be named whatever you want and added to meta columns.
Positions are 1-based, not 0-based as .bed.
Import with import.ofst

\examples{
## GRanges
gr <- GRanges("1:1-3:-")
# export.ofst(gr, file = "path.ofst")
## GAlignment
# Make input data.frame
df <- data.frame(seqnames = "1", cigar = "3M", start = 1L, strand = "+")
ga <- ORFik:::getGAlignments(df)
# export.ofst(ga, file = "path.ofst")
}
