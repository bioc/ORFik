\usage{
findORFsFasta(
  filePath,
  startCodon = startDefinition(1),
  stopCodon = stopDefinition(1),
  longestORF = TRUE,
  minimumLength = 0,
  is.circular = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filePath}{(character) Path to the fasta file. Can be both uppercase or
lowercase.}

\item{startCodon}{(character vector) Possible START codons to search for.
Check \code{\link{startDefinition}} for helper function.}

\item{stopCodon}{(character vector) Possible STOP codons to search for.
Check \code{\link{stopDefinition}} for helper function.}

\item{longestORF}{(logical) Default TRUE. Keep only the longest ORF per
unique (seqname, strand, stopcodon) combination, you can also use function
\code{\link{longestORFs}} after creation of ORFs for same result.}

\item{minimumLength}{(integer) Default is 0. Which is START + STOP = 6 bp.
Minimum length of ORF, without counting 3bps for START and STOP codons.
For example minimumLength = 8 will result in size of ORFs to be at least
START + 8*3 (bp) + STOP = 30 bases. Use this param to restrict search.}

\item{is.circular}{(logical) Whether the genome in filePath is circular.
Prokaryotic genomes are usually circular. Be carefull if you want to
extract sequences, remember that seqlengths must be set, else it does not
know what last base in sequence is before loop ends!}
}
\value{
(GRanges) object of ORFs mapped from fasta file. Positions are
relative to the fasta file.
}
\description{
Should be used for procaryote genomes or transcript sequences as fasta.
Makes no sence for eukaryote whole genomes, since it contains splicing.
Searches through each fasta header and reports all ORFs found for BOTH
sense (+) and antisense strand (-) in all frames. Name of the header will
be used as seqnames of reported ORFs.
Each fasta header is treated separately, and name of the sequence will
be used as seqname in returned GRanges object. This supports circluar
genomes.
}
\details{
Remember if you have a fasta file of transcripts (transcript coordinates),
delete all negative stranded ORFs afterwards by:
orfs <- orfs[strandBool(orfs)] # negative strand orfs make no sense then.
Seqnames are created from header by format: >name info, so name must be
first after "biggern than" and space between name and info.
Also make sure your fasta file is valid (no hidden spaces etc),
 as this might break the coordinate system!
